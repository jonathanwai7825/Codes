## Read Table in R
```{r}
Dat=read.table("GPA.txt", header=F)
names(Dat)<-c("GPA","ACT")
head(Dat)
```

## Assign name 
```{r}
GPA=c(Dat$GPA)
ACT=c(Dat$ACT)
```

## (a) Mean and Variance of GPA
```{r}
summary(GPA)
```
Mean of GPA is 3.074

```{r}
var(GPA)
```
Variance of GPA is 0.4151719

## (a) Mean and Variance of ACT
```{r}
summary(ACT)
```
Mean of ACT is 24.73

```{r}
var(ACT)
```
Variance of ACT is 19.99937

## (b) Correlation between ACT score and GPA. 
```{r}
cor.test(ACT,GPA)
```
Correlation between ACT and GPA is 0.2694818. Strong evidence of a a linear relationship. 

A weak positive linear relationship between the ACT and GPA

## (c) Fit a simple linear regression using ACT score as the explanatory variable, and GPA as the response variable.
```{r}
GPA.lm <- lm(GPA ~ ACT, data=Dat)
```

## (d) What is the estimated intercept and slope of the regression line?
```{r}
GPA.lm
```
Estimated intercept is 2.11405

Slope of regression line is 0.03883

## (e) Write in words the interpretation of the slope.
For each 1 point increase in ACT score, GPA score increases by 0.03883

## (f) What is the standard deviation around the regression line, i.e. estimate population variance ?

Residual standard error (RSE): 0.6231 

Residual sum of squares (RSS): 0.6231^2 * 118 = rse^2 * df= 45.81393

## (g) Use a t-test to determine whether or not there is a linear relationship between ACT score and GPA.
```{r}
summary(GPA.lm)
```

H0 :b1 =0 against HA :b1 != 0.

Null hypothesis: No statistical significance between GPA and ACT

Alternative hypothesis: Statistical significance between GPA and ACT

T-test is 3.040 with p value 0.00292 
P value is less than alpha, therefore we reject null hypothesis. There is a statistical significance between the two vairables 

This means that there is a linear relationship between Act score and GPA 
GPA can be a perdictor of ACT score 

## (h) Construct a scatter plot of the length of the tibia against the length of the humerus. Superimpose the regression line.
```{r}
plot(GPA ~ ACT, data=Dat)
abline(coef(GPA.lm), col="orange")
```

Regression line: y = 2.11405 + 0.3883(x) 

## (i) Compute the ANOVA table corresponding to the model.
```{r}
anova(GPA.lm)
```

## (j) From the table determine the mean square error(MSE).
```{r}
mean(summary(GPA.lm)$residuals^2)
```
Mean Square Error:  0.6231^2 * 118  / 120 = rss / n = 0.3818

Mean Square Error is 0.3818134

##(k) Use the ANOVA F-test to determine whether or not there is a linear relationship between ACT score and GPA.
F value is 9.2402

F(0.95,1,118) = 3.92

Since F value 9.24 > 3.92 we conclude b1 != 0

Reject the null-hypothesis 

There is a linear relationship between ACT score and GPA 

##(l) How do the results in (k) compare to those in (g)?
Rejecting null-hypothesis in both situations 

##(m) What proportion of the variation in GPA is explained by the regression model?
R^2 = SSreg / SST = 1 - RSS / SST 
```{r}
summary(GPA.lm)$r.square
```
This implies 75.283% of the variability have been accounted for and the remaining 21.717% of the variability is still unaccounted for. 

Indication that the fit is good

##(n) Construct a 95% confidence interval for the estimated mean GPA of students whose ACT test score was 28.
```{r}
predict(GPA.lm, data.frame(ACT=28), interval = "confidence", level = 0.95, se.fit = TRUE)
```
95% of students with an ACT score of 28 will score a GPA between 3.06 and 3.34

##(o) Construct a 95% prediction interval for a particular student whose ACT test score was 20.
```{r}
predict(GPA.lm, data.frame(ACT=20), interval = "prediction", level = 0.95, se.fit = TRUE)
```
With a test score of 20 on the ACT, the student is perdicted to score between a GPA of 1.645753 and 4.13543. We have a 95% confidence interval.
